## Experience
- Worked as a market research analyst focused on national TV markets and later as a QA analyst in a large media research company.
- Developed back end fulfillment systems for an ad agency with a focus on increasing cost efficiency by increasing mail deliverability.
- Migrated a widely used multi-line case management system from Informix to SQL Server while targeting hot spots in the old classic ASP system for replacement.  This was done by developing new product lines in ASP.net / C# and registering a core library with COM to facilitate data sharing between ASP.net and classic ASP.  
- Worked on a collateral management application used by institutional traders to settle accounts, with a focus on changes brought about by the Dodd-Frank Act.
- Worked as a consultant with a large publishing company to build out the first generation of their digital content platform while they constructed a team to run it.  This involved development of several new products from whole cloth, and also helping content producers integrate with these products and the SSO system our team also worked on.  Helped mentor junior developers for the client and eventually made myself unnecessary.
- Built a set of highly configurable services for a consulting company that can be used to rapidly establish two-way connectivity between edge-native and cloud-native systems.
