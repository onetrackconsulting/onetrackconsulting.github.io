I am a full stack consultant specializing in distributed systems across the full SDLC including early stage product development, rescue and retirement. Very experienced with traditional bare metal, cloud native and hybrid deployments and also with bare metal "edge native" deployments widely used in industrial IOT applications.  Also very experienced working with open source projects, both as a maintainer and as an outside contributor.

Most of my domain experience has been in the health care, financial and education spaces but I have been able to learn new ones quickly historically speaking. I don't favor any particular flavor but I do enjoy agile methodologies when well applied to the unique problems teams face.  I have extensive experience working with international clients and distributed teams as well.  Open to full and part time engagements out of the eastern time zone at present with +/- 5 hr flexibility.
